    "text": "OVERVIEW\nWe live in an increasingly data-driven world. Basic data literacy and data science skills are becoming central to virtually every industry. Yet, limited opportunities exist to gain these skills without an advanced background in math and computer science. To address this workforce development need, we propose a competitively valued on-line graduate certificate in the Professional Applications in Data Science. The certificate is designed to offer rigorous training in the foundations of data science to anyone with a bachelor’s degree. Participants will learn how to think about, organize, analyze, and visualize data, and communicate data driven insights to diverse audiences. The curriculum emphasizes the use of data sets drawn from each student’s individual discipline, aligning the certificate’s workforce development impacts with the University of Idaho’s land grant mission.\n\nValue Proposition:\nThe graduate certificate in Professional Applications in Data Science will provide unique value to UI constituencies by:\n\nAligning data science training with fields of nascent demand that are part of our land grant mission, including Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Education.\nRequiring a digital data science portfolio with which students can demonstrate their proficiencies to potential employers.\nEmphasizing training in data communication - including verbal presentation and data visualization - two components of data science that are underrepresented in competing certificates.\nFilling a growing workforce development gap by offering a unique data science certificate that is appropriate for professionals with a bachelor’s degree who do not have a rigorous background in mathematics, statistics, or computer science.\n\n\n\nIntended Audience:\nThis certificate leverages the University of Idaho’s interdisciplinary culture to provide integrative training in the foundations of data science. It is intended for:\n\nWorking professionals with a bachelor’s degree whose career increasingly involves the generation, management, analysis, and visualization of large data sets. The certificate is appropriate for professionals in STEM fields, Health Care, Business, Government, Education, Journalism, Athletics, Natural Resources, and Agriculture.\nGraduate students in programs outside of the core technical disciplines of data science (statistics, math, engineering, or computer science). The certificate will complement disciplinary research methods courses with training in data management, visualization, and communication.\nUndergraduates at the UI who wish to incorporate data science training into their degree and graduate with a Bachelor’s degree and a graduate certificate.\n\n\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes:\nUpon completion of the certificate, students will be able to:\n\nUse open-source software to reproducibly manage, analyze, and visualize large, complex, and noisy data sets.\nPractice high quality and ethical data stewardship.\nUnderstand and execute data exploration.\nEffectively communicate data driven insights to experts and non-experts.\nDemonstrate their skills with an online portfolio of analyses and visualizations relevant to their field of specialization."

    "section": "LITERATE PROGRAMMING PUBLISHING SYSTEMS",
    "text": "LITERATE PROGRAMMING PUBLISHING SYSTEMS\nI’m trying to keep this course as technology agnostic as I can. The idea is that you should be practicing and building competencies in the languages and algorithms that are most useful to you. Who am I to tell you to use R instead of Python? If you have skills in a particular language I encourage you to keep using that during this course. That being said, I am going to work the examples using R and R Studio, and I will (mostly) use Quarto as the literate programming framework.\nIf all of this is new to you, no problem. Just follow along in R and Quarto and start your skill building journey with those languages.\nIf you are a Python person, great! Quarto can accommodate that language as well. If you have another preference for literate programming, such as sticking with R Markdown until the Quarto bugs are fixed, that is great. Find the framework and tools that work for you, and practice, practice, practice!\n\nQuarto\nAn open source publishing system that allows you to create websites, documents, blogs, books, publications, presentations, and more while using R, Python, Julia, or Observable. Quarto is intended to be the more functional successor of R Markdown. I intend to use Quarto for most of my work in this course.\n\n\nR Markdown\nAnother publishing system for creating all the things … websites, slides, manuscripts, dashboards, etc. While most people (including me!) instinctively think of R and Python within R Markdown, the list of supported language engines is pretty extensive.\n\nnames(knitr::knit_engines$get())\n\n [1] \"awk\"       \"bash\"      \"coffee\"    \"gawk\"      \"groovy\"    \"haskell\"  \n [7] \"lein\"      \"mysql\"     \"node\"      \"octave\"    \"perl\"      \"php\"      \n[13] \"psql\"      \"Rscript\"   \"ruby\"      \"sas\"       \"scala\"     \"sed\"      \n[19] \"sh\"        \"stata\"     \"zsh\"       \"asis\"      \"asy\"       \"block\"    \n[25] \"block2\"    \"bslib\"     \"c\"         \"cat\"       \"cc\"        \"comment\"  \n[31] \"css\"       \"ditaa\"     \"dot\"       \"embed\"     \"eviews\"    \"exec\"     \n[37] \"fortran\"   \"fortran95\" \"go\"        \"highlight\" \"js\"        \"julia\"    \n[43] \"python\"    \"R\"         \"Rcpp\"      \"sass\"      \"scss\"      \"sql\"      \n[49] \"stan\"      \"targets\"   \"tikz\"      \"verbatim\"  \"ojs\"       \"mermaid\""

    "section": "LANGUAGES AND TOOLSETS",
    "text": "LANGUAGES AND TOOLSETS\nThere are quite a few, but the five that seemed to keep coming up as I prepped this course are:\n\nR\nA very powerful open source framework for statistical computing and graphics. R has a lot of base functionality, and its capabilities are increased by 100 fold with packages created by R users. Packages are the core units of R code. I’m going to use R for the vast majority of demonstrations in this course.\n\n\nPython\nPython is an open source general purpose programming language. It wasn’t developed just for statistical computing or data science, and people use this language for tons of different applications. There is no denying it has become a very powerful language for data science and data visualization.\n\n\nTableau\nTableau is proprietary software that is very powerful for creating beautiful and functional data visualizations. It can integrate with all sorts of data sources and is used a lot for analytics, especially in the business world. The downsides (that occur to me at least) are that it costs money, it is not open source, and is more of a one-trick-pony than the programming languages on this list. It may be a great tool in your communication tool kit, but you will need to use additional things for communication tasks that go beyond “showing” into speaking and writing.\n\n\nJavascript\nJavascript has been around for about 25 years, and is (I think) the world’s most popular programming language. Along with HTML and CSS, Javascript drives pretty much the entire internet. I mention Javascript here because it has the D3 library, which can create super cool interactive data visualizaitons. In my experience, the learning curve with Javascript and D3 was pretty steep. I bought a book about it once, but just haven’t been able to allocate the amount of time necessary to really start using it. Check out the gallery of examples. Amazing!\n\n\nObservable / D3\nObservable is a set of extensions to Javascript that features something called reactive runtime. This means that the code blocks are executed and compiled as they are written, and changes are implemented instantaneously. Observable is pretty great for data exploration, and is well supported by Quarto. In addition, you can use the Observable JS libraries in Quarto to access D3. We’ll use some of these tools in this course, especially when we start considering interactivity."

I think this is causing some issues that I haven’t fully dealt with. I don’t recommend putting your local directory on any kind of shared or networked drive.\n\nI suggest making the directory name something informative, like BCB521Portfolio, but hey… If you want to call your repository HasturBoxerShorts I won’t stop you.\nMost of you will select Knitr as your Engine, but if you were a Python coder you might select Jupyter.\nCheck Create a git repository. At some point, you might be asked about making the repository private. Uncheck that box and make it public. Otherwise the website functionality of GitHub pages won’t work. The other boxes are optional and we can talk more about them later.\nClick CREATE PROJECT.\n\nNow you’ve got a BLOG template all set up! Ha Ha! Onward to Internet Fame!\n\n\n1B - Make the BLOG about you.\nWe won’t spend a ton of time here, because this will be an ongoing process.
