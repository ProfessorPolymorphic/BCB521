## CENTRAL DOGMA

Who is the AUDIENCE and what is the GOAL?

![](polisci.png)

## THE AUDIENCE

What kind of audiences?

Can they be categorized or grouped?

## THE GOAL

What kind of goals?

Can they be categorized or grouped?

## THE STRATEGY

How can the goal be achieved with this audience?

Is this concept too abstract to discuss?

## THE MEDIUM

What are the possible communication channels with our audience?

How do these channels align with our modes of communication (showing, speaking, writing)?

## TECHNICAL COMPONENTS

[Literate Programming](../A1-Lit-Prog/index.qmd)

Version Control

Artificial Intelligence

## SUMMARY {.smaller}

**Who is the [AUDIENCE]{.red}? What is the [GOAL]{.red}?**

::: panel-tabset
## AUDIENCE

-   **Receptivity:** Are they hostile to your message, or predisposed to it?
-   **Influence:** Do they have the power to help you achieve your goal?
-   **Engagement:** Are you competing with other factors for their attention?
-   **Expertise:** How much prior knowledge do they have related to your content?
-   **Needs:** What type of affordances must you provide? Consider the required access to technology for your communication.
-   **Expectations:** Are there disciplinary or cultural norms or expectations (e.g. formality, format, content)?
-   **Diversity:** How big is the audience, and how much variation in the above characteristics may exist among individuals?
-   **Goals:** Your audience has goals too. How do their goals align with yours?

## GOALS

1.  **Overarching goals (Long-term Objectives):** Get the job, sell the product, get elected, confirm or refute your hypothesis.

2.  **Communication-Specific goals (Immediate Objectives):** Inform the voters, educate the students, persuade the legislator, motivate the staff, solve a problem.

3.  **Multiple Goals:** Most communications will have multiple goals across these categories. The challenge is often in balancing these goals effectively.

4.  **Alignment:** Ensure that your communication-specific goals align with your overarching goals and are appropriate for your audience characteristics.

5.  **Measurability:** Where possible, try to make goals specific and measurable. This can help in evaluating the success of your communication.

6.  **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust your goals based on feedback or changing circumstances.
