## WHO ARE YOU?

"...The course is designed to be "discipline agnostic" - each student is encouraged to use their own data, or public data sets that they deem important / interesting. ..."

### Briefly:

-   Your name
-   Your discipline
-   Your degree progress
-   Your technical proficiency 

## COURSE SUMMARY

Students completing this course will be able to:

::: r-fit-text
1.  Identify, understand, and describe the critical characteristics, needs, and expectations of the various audiences with whom they will communicate.

2. Develop and apply effective writing and presentation skills to communicate data-driven insights clearly and impactfully to both specialist and general audiences.

3. Implement reproducible research practices using literate programming (Quarto/Markdown) and version control (GitHub) to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of their work.

4. Create compelling narratives around data that are tailored to specific disciplines while remaining accessible to interdisciplinary audiences.

5. Critically evaluate and apply appropriate data visualization techniques to support written and verbal communications, enhancing the accessibility of complex data analysis results.

## CENTRAL DOGMA

Who is the AUDIENCE and what is the GOAL?

## THE AUDIENCE

What kind of audiences?  Can they be categorized or grouped?

## THE GOAL

What kind of goals?  Can they be categorized or grouped?


## THE STRATEGY

How can the goal be achieved with this audience?  Is this concept too abstract to discuss?

## THE MEDIUM

What are the possible communication channels with our audience?  How do these channels align with our modes of communication (showing, speaking, writing)?



## TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
