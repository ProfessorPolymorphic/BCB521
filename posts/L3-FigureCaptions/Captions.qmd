## Writing About Data

A figure is worth 1000 words.... or some crap... I don't know...

## REMEMBER OUR THEME!

**Who is the Audience?  What is the goal?**

Any general advice can be invalidated by your specific requirements.  For example, the Associate Editor of the Journal *Science* won't care what you learned in this class.  They have guidelines and you must follow them.

## SELF CONTAINED

The caption and the figure should create a stand alone entity that can be understood without reference to the main text of the document.  Components may include:

- Declarative Title.
- Methods.
- Statistical Information.

## DECLARATIVE TITLE

... or not?

A **Declarative Title** summarizes your result or main finding. This may or may not be appropriate. Is the title clarifying the communication or biasing the reader?

## METHODS AND STATISTICS

## CAPTION vs LEGEND
