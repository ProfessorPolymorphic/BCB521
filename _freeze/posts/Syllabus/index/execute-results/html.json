Robison**\n\n**Spring 2024**\n\n## Course Description\n\nThis class will help students establish a core understanding of data visualization. We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R programming language. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using R. The course is designed to be \"discipline agnostic\" - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\n\n## Course Objectives\n\nStudents completing this course will be able to:\n\n1.  Describe and manipulate tabular, network, and spatial data; transform these data into a form suitable for visualization.\n2.  Analyze data visualization design choices related to marks and channels, spatial arrangement, and components of color.\n3.  Design new data visualizations with appropriate use of visual channels for tabular, network, and spatial data with quantitative and categorical attributes.\n4.  Implement their data visualization designs using existing tools in R (or other toolkits preferred by the student).\n5.  Explain whether a visual encoding is perceptually appropriate for a specific combination of task and data.\n6.  Demonstrate their skills with at least two novel visualizations suitable for inclusion in an online Data Science Portfolio.\n\n## Required Readings\n\nTamara Munzner. Visualization Analysis and Design. A K Peters Visualization Series, CRC Press, 2014. While the book is not required, I do emphasize the structure and approach to visualization that Dr. Munzner has developed.\n\n[Hard Copy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Analysis-Design-AK-Peters/dp/1466508914/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5AX2UJ4ZP5Y&keywords=munzner&qid=1670957518&sprefix=munzner%2Caps%2C237&sr=8-1)\n\n[kindle/ebook on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Analysis-Design-AK-Peters-ebook/dp/B00OGLE3XE/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1670957518&sr=8-1)\n\n## Course Policies\n\n### GRADING\n\n50% of your grade will be determined by homework exercises related to each course unit.\n\n20% of your grade will be determined by a mid term project (which would be a great item to include in your Data Science Portfolio).\n\n20% of your grade will be determined by a final project (which would be great item to include in your Data Science Portfolio).\n\n10% of your grade will be determined by participation in class discussions.\n\nGRADING SCALE: The grading scale is standard: A (90 -100 %), B (89 - 80 %), C (79 - 70 %), D (69-60 %), F( below 60 %).\n\n### ATTENDANCE POLICY\n\nMissing a scheduled class session is at your discretion. I will be posting all the course materials online. If a discussion or in-class exercise occurs and you miss it, you will lose those participation points. There is no way to make up those points.\n\n### LATE ARRIVAL OF PROFESSOR POLICY\n\nThe R Markdown template I used for this syllabus was created by Dr. Steven V. Miller at Stockholm University. It contained this section, which I found amusing and have therefore retained. Professor Miller's current university asks professors to have policies written into their syllabus about what students should do if the professor is more than 15 minutes late to class. Here is my version of that policy:\n\nI will inform students via e-mail in advance of class if class is cancelled for the day. Events that might create such a scenario include travel obligations that emerged after the semester has begun, a family emergency that encompasses multiple days, or some other thing. I will also contact our department secretary in emergent situations, such as something happening on the way to work. Failing that, assume the worst. Alien abduction, the return of one or more Old Ones to our plane, or some kind of attack by wizards are all viable explanations for my inability to attend class. I ask that the students make sure that my story gets the proper treatment on the \"Mr. Ballen\" YouTube channel. I also ask that my story be narrated by Morgan Freeman and that the role of me in the made for TV movie be played by Keanu Reeves or Danny DeVito.\n\n### MAKE UP EXAM POLICY\n\nThe bad news is that there are NO make-ups for missed exams. Don't bother asking. The good news is that there aren't any exams.\n\n### ACADEMIC DISHONESTY POLICY\n\nAll students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty. This includes but is not limited to: not cheating, not using the ideas of others without giving appropriate credit (including AI tools), and not falsifying data. Any incident of academic dishonesty will be handled according to the guidelines of the University of Idaho.\n\n## Class Schedule\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nSchedule <- read_excel(\"Schedule.xlsx\")\n\nknitr::kable(Schedule, caption = '')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: \n\n|DATE       |TOPIC                                          |ACTIVITY              |RESOURCES  |\n|:----------|:----------------------------------------------|:---------------------|:----------|\n|2024-01-11 |Introduction and Overview                      |NA                    |NA         |\n|2024-01-16 |NA                                             |[Literate Programming](posts/T1-Lit-Prog/index.qmd)|[Tutorial 1](posts/T1-Lit-Prog/index.qmd)|\n|2024-01-18 |NA                                             |NA                    |NA         |\n|2024-01-23 |NA                                             |NA                    |NA         |\n|2024-01-25 |Why Viz matters                                |NA                    |NA         |\n|2024-01-30 |WHAT?  Abstraction of Data                     |NA                    |NA         |\n|2024-02-01 |WHY?  Task Abstraction                         |NA                    |NA         |\n|2024-02-06 |NA                                             |NA                    |NA         |\n|2024-02-08 |MARKS.
